  In past decade, the rate of natural disaster has seen a huge a surge causing  great havoc.Some measures are have been taken to gather resources but in most of the cases the resources could not be distributed proportionally.

  So the idea is to keep a track of all the schools, buildings, public places etc. of a city in a database and also monitor the population density during different times (e.g. if the disaster would have struck during day time,there will be a good number of children in places like schools ,and Employees in office etc.
  Each of buildings and public place will be stored in the database with details and parameters(ex:capacity,purpose etc).
All of this will be done in form of density geographical maps.
So we will be having a database of all the public places in the city and try to inculcate the google map traffic colour change technique to denote the population density.If we find that a particular area needs a more attention as well as have more requirement for funds/resources, that place will be located first in priority.

<div class="" style={padding-left:50px;font-size: 30px;
    font-style: italic;}>
  Having a database of the buildings will also help in the identification of the buildings which have a high storeys or strong foundation etc.
  The reason behind their identification is that in case of a natural calamity,there can be arrangements made so that people occupy to the “safe spots” type buildings .
  Example ,Having a database of high storeys buildings will help in marking a “safe spot” in case of floods and strong foundation will help in case of eathquakes etc.
</div>

<div class=""  style={padding-left:50px;font-size: 30px;
    font-style: italic;}>
  We can search for suitable places for safe spots from our database.
  But to make the idea successful there will be an obvious requirement for the funds. There will be a facility in the site where the user will read an emotional appeal on the severity of the cause and ask him/her to donate.
  For this we will be including a PAYTM,PAYPAL or any other suitable payment gateway which will surely make it an easy experience for users to donate for the cause.

<div class="">
  Funds collected will be used efficiently and allocated for different purposes according to severity  of the issue.
Having the knowledge about purpose and capabilities of each buildings and places we can track down the grocery  stores,transportation companies etc, to which the funds can be allocated commercially so that there is no delay in the resources needed for the people’s rehabilitation.
